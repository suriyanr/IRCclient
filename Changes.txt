Feb 17th Beta release and changes:
==================================
Changes in Feb 17th Release since the Feb 1st release:
a) Improved the FileSearch Tab - Now Sends and Queues information is added.
b) Improved the FileSearch Tab - Buttons added to "List All", "List Nick" etc. 
   Also buttons added to limit search to open sends, and/or open queues
c) Added a right click popup menu, which works on the currently highlighted 
   nick. (Portcheck, portcheckme, dcc send, update files, list files)
d) Moved to FOX UI toolkit version 1.4.6
e) Double clicking on a queued item in the "File Server" tab, one can force 
   send the file.
f) Removed the !list on channel entry, as it was generating too much traffic.

Note: There is still an intermittent crash when focus is on the "File Server" 
      or "Downloads" Tab. Hence switch focus to some other TAB to avoid crashes.


Apr 5th Beta release and changes:
=================================
Changes in Apr 5th Release since the Feb 17th release:
a) DCC Send remembers dir which was used to last send a file. Hence opens
   up the same directory, the next time.
b) Serves all sub directories within Serving Folder too.
c) Traverse sub directories while accessing another's server and get file
   listing within sub directories. 
d) Added a "PWD" command to a MasalaMate server. (Print working directory).
e) GUI Dir->Update Server added. This will update the files MasalaMate is
   serving, if user populates or removes files from the Serving Folder and
   its sub directories.
f) Completed downloads and Partial Downloads remain in the "Downloads" TAB.
   Can be individually removed or cleared.
g) Implemented a "Fast File List Collection algorithm". Lets call it FFLC.
   This is in alpha stage. With this algorithm, we are able to get the
   approximate files served in the channel within a few minutes, without
   generating too much traffic.
h) Implemented "Advertisement synchronisation". Lets call it AS. This helps
   in relieving the load on the servers so that MasalaMate clients do not
   dump their Ad at arbitrary times. With this algorithm in place, the
   advertisements will come in spaced every 3 minutes and in order.
